Welcome to ConU Hax X's blockchain-powered rewards system! This guide will help you understand how to earn badges and claim them as NFTs on the Solana blockchain.

### NFTs (On-Chain)
If you connect a Phantom wallet:
- 🎁 Your badges are **minted as Solana NFTs**
- 🔗 NFTs are sent **directly to your wallet**
- ⚡ Future badges **automatically become NFTs**
- 💎 You **own** your achievements on the blockchain

## ❓ FAQ

### Do I need a Phantom wallet?
**No!** You can use the platform without a wallet. Badges still appear on your profile.

### What if I connect my wallet later?
**All your existing badges will be minted as NFTs** when you first connect.

### Can I disconnect my wallet?
**Yes**, but your wallet address stays linked to your account (so you can reconnect and claim future badges).

### What if minting fails?
The badge is still earned and appears on your profile. NFT minting failure doesn't affect your progress.

### Can I transfer my NFTs?
**Yes!** Once in your wallet, you can:
- Transfer to another wallet
- Sell on NFT marketplaces
- Display in your Phantom wallet
- Use in other Solana dApps

### Do NFTs expire?
**No!** NFTs are permanent and stored on the blockchain forever.

### Can I claim NFTs for old badges?
**Yes!** When you connect your wallet, all unclaimed badges automatically become NFTs.
